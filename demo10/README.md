#Demo 10: time delays

This demo constructs the logic circuit (NOT A) OR (B AND C) and adds some delays to examine the delayed change in output

The top.v also uses the $monitor display task to display the change in signal values over time.

$monitor is a system task that prints the variables/expressions in its arguments list any time one of the variables in the list changes
